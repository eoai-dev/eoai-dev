## Hey, I'm Eddie 👋

Been building stuff since high school. Entrepreneur, self-taught engineer, and I spend way too much time thinking about how to make AI actually useful in the real world.

### What I'm up to

**Director of Emerging Technology** @ [Winmill Software](https://winmill.com)  
**Founder** @ [Orchata Labs](https://orchata.ai)

Right now I'm deep in AI/ML, mostly focused on the boring but important problems: making it easier to train, deploy, and actually use AI in production.

### Things I've built

🥛 [**Orchata**](https://github.com/orchata-ai) - Knowledge infrastructure for AI agents. Add your data in minutes.

💼 [**Bizbe**](https://bizbe.com) - AI-native M&A brokerage for FedEx ISP acquisitions

🎯 [**Vantige**](https://vantige.ai) - AI-powered deal sourcing

🎨 [**Siga Studio**](https://siga.design) - Voice-driven image design (AITX Hackathon People's Choice Award)

### Currently exploring

Reinforcement learning, vision models, world models

### Let's talk

**Looking for:** People who know GTM and marketing (always), and anyone building OSS in AI/ML, especially if you're into TypeScript and Bun.
